ExtJSX
======
JSX Transformer support for ExtJS - a simple modification to the ExtJS class loader.

It intercepts the loader and looks at the currently loading classname. 
If a part of the classname matches (currently hardcoded) `react` it loads the script via `JSXTransformer.load`, if not normal execuction continues.

How to use
==========

1. Include JSXtransformer.js before extjsx.js, which in turn should be included after ExtJS.
2. Either use a folder structure like `app/react/...` or modify `scope.LAST_CLASS_NAME.indexOf('react') !== -1` in the extjsx.js file.
3. You can use JSX syntax in your `app/react/...` files (or in a custom one).
